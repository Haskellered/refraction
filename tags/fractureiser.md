Starting June 6th, 2023 UTC, there have been reports of malware being distributed through websites such as Curseforge, Bukkit, and possibly others in the form of mods, plugins, and modpacks. **We recommend against downloading/updating mods or launching Minecraft at all for now**. 

This is a rapidly changing situation, and for the most up to date information you should go to [this](https://hackmd.io/@jaskarth4/B1gaTOaU2) document. We have also provided resources to help users find out what to do next [here](https://prismlauncher.org/news/cf-compromised-alert/#what-can-i-do). This includes scripts for both Windows and Linux (the operating systems known to be affected so far) to help you find out if your system has been infected. In the case files are found, they should be deleted - however, we still recomend to **change all of your passwords**, especially for accounts with login information saved in your browser.
