Windows auto-updating is only supported on 8.0+. For now, you will need to download the installer and run it again in order to update. You will not lose your instances.

Prism Launcher auto-updates for macOS using the [Sparkle Framework](https://sparkle-project.org/).

For Linux, just use your package manager! Appimage and portable auto-updating has been added in 8.0.
